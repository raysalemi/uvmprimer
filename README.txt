THE UVM PRIMER CODE EXAMPLES (Rev 1.0)

There is nothing worse than a syntax error in a technical teaching
book; the poor student is already learning new things and the error is
just an unecessary curve ball.

To avoid that problem, I've compiled and simulated every example in
THE UVM PRIMER and included the examples here.  You can run these code
examples with any simulator that supports the UVM.

All the examples come with a run.do file that compiles and runs the
example in Mentor Graphic's Questa simulator. You can run these
examples with this command line:

% vsim -c -do run.do

If you'd like to use the GUI, remove the "-c" option.

The example directories follow the chapter numbers and titles in the
book.  In some cases there are several examples in a chapter, so there
are subdirectories for those.

You can watch videos that describe the examples on Youtube. There is a
link to the videos on http://www.uvmprimer.com. 

You can ask questions about the examples on the Facebook group.  There
is a link to the Facebook group on http://www.uvmprimer.com.

Enjoy the examples!
